# Glaucoma Detection Web App

This project implements a web application for detecting signs of glaucoma in eye images using machine learning. The web app is powered by Gradio and deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.

## Overview

The Glaucoma Detection Web App allows users to upload an eye image, and the underlying machine learning model predicts whether the image contains signs of glaucoma or not. The model is trained on a dataset of eye images and uses deep learning techniques for classification.

## Usage

1. **Upload Image**: Click on the "Upload Image" button to select an eye image from your device.
2. **Prediction**: Once the image is uploaded, the model will make a prediction and display the result as either "Glaucoma" or "Normal".

Watch the demo video to see how to use the Glaucoma Detection Web App.
